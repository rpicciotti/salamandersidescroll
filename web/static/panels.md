Panel 1 - Introduction

ChessWar is game of real-time team chess. It is designed to convey what it is like to wage a war.

There are two teams in ChessWar: the Blue Team and the Red Team.

The goal of the game is to kill the enemy king.

The game occurs on two levels: the Map and the Chessboard.

The Map is where players move around. The Chessboard is exactly what it sounds like - it is where the Chess Game takes place.

---------------

Panel 2 - The Map

The Map contains four elements: team bases, team outposts, minefields, and the battlefield.

Each team has a white base that contains both the gray Command Center and three yellow Briefings. There are also white northern and southern outposts. The northern outpost contains the purple Armory, and the southern outpost contains the blue SCIF.

Minefields are large black areas that kill you if you touch them.

The battlefield is the central white zone where player can interact with the Chessboard. It is surrounded by a green DMZ, or De-Militarized Zone.

---------------

Panel 3 - The General

In order to kill the enemy king, your team must make chess moves.

To do that, someone on your team needs to enter the Command Center and press spacebar to become a General. This will pop open a screen that allows the General to issue Orders. The General selects one of the three yellow Briefing options, then selects a starting square on the chessboard, and finally an ending square. This assigns that Order to that Briefing.

---------------

Panel 4 - The Soldier

Once Orders have been assigned to the Briefings, your team needs to complete these orders.

To do so, a Soldier enters one of the three Briefings, and presses spacebar to grab the orders assigned to that Briefing. You will see these orders displaying on the left side of your HUD.

Next you must run these orders to the Battlefield, and press spacebar again to complete the orders.

---------------

Panel 5 - The Operative

Now here's the thing. Once a Soldier has completed their Order, the Order will succeed _only if it contained a valid chess move according to the normal rules of chess_. The soldier will not be told whether or not the orders were completed. If the orders were created with incomplete knowledge of the Chessboard, then it is possible they appeared to be valid orders, but in fact were not.

This is where the Operative comes in. The General needs the best Intel to issue the best Orders. The job of the Operative is to gather Intel.

To do this, a player must first travel to the SCIF and press spacebar to become an Operative. Then they run to the Battlefield to gather Intel. Finally, they must run back to the SCIF to report this Intel. Once this is completed, the entire team's COP (Common Operating Picture), or their view of the Chessboard, will be updated.

In addition to this, the Operator may choose to run all the way into the enemy Command Center, and conduct Espionage. This gets a copy of the current enemy Orders. They then run back to the SCIF to report their Espionage. This communicates to the General the Orders they copied.

---------------

Panel 6 - The Tank

Last of all, we have the Tank. A player becomes a Tank in the Armory.

A Tank does not issue Orders, does not complete Orders, does not gather Intel, and does not gather Espionage.

A Tank's job is to disrupt the operations of the enemy by killing enemy Soldiers, Operatives, and enemy Tanks.

---------------

Panel 7 - Overview

To summarize:

Generals issue Orders that contain Chess Moves.

Soldiers grab these Orders, run them to the Battlefield, and complete them.

Operatives gather Intel and Espionage, and report these to the SCIF.

Tanks kill enemy Soldiers, Operatives, and enemy Tanks.

Now go, get to ChessWar-ing!
